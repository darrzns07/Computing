Mr Ong's Lesson</br>
It was not our first lesson in the lab. Mr Ong was teaching us about the first part of ECM and we were doing a practical. </br>
We knew Mr Ong only as a lenient teacher who made jokes and quite often, horrible puns. </br>
That day, after finishing up the experiment, we were supposed to wash all the beakers and materials we used. </br>
However, some students were having fun mixing the chemicals we used and Mr Ong reminded us not to do so. </br>
We were ignorant and did not listen. </br>
Mr Ong shocked us when he raised his voice drastically and screamed at us to stop. </br>
Only then did the class stop everything they were doing and pay attention to Mr Ong's lecture on lab safety. </br>
This taught us to respect his authority even if he was lenient and to not take advantage of him despite his kindness. </br>
It also taught us proper lab safety and was a very important lesson.
However, Mr Ong had to leave school to attend a teaching course. 
I hope that he will be my science teacher again next year.</br>
The end.</br>
